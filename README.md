## Assignment 1: Holiday Destination Application

This application allows users to choose their favorite holiday destination from a predefined list. Based on the user's selection, the application will display their favorite destination. This project focuses on user interaction and simple commands by input from the user.

## Assignment 2: AMKA Prediction Application

The AMKA (Greek Social Security Number) application takes an AMKA number and the current year as inputs to predict the sex of the individual. This project demonstrates the use of string manipulation and basic algorithms in Java.

### Features

- Input fields for AMKA number and current year.
- Random prediction of the individual's sex based on the provided AMKA number and use of modulo.

## Assignment 3: Screen Coordinates Application

This application displays the coordinates of the window screen in real-time. It is a simple yet effective tool for understanding screen positioning and event handling in Java.

### Features

- Real-time display of the window's screen coordinates.
- Dynamic updating of coordinates as the window moves.

## Assignment 4: URLs Visited Tracker Application

This application tracks and displays the URLs visited by a user. It logs each visited URL and provides an interface for viewing the list of all visited URLs. The application demonstrates file handling, data storage, and GUI elements in Java.

### Features

- Tracks and logs each URL visited by the user.
- Displays a list of all visited URLs in a user-friendly interface.
- Demonstrates the use of file handling for data persistence.
- Implements GUI components for better user interaction.

## Assignment 5: URLs Visited Menu Application

This application provides a menu-driven interface for analyzing URLs from files. Users can either input the name of a file containing URLs or specify a directory path to analyze all files within it. The application uses functionalities from the URLsVisited class to process and display the URLs, including removing duplicates and sorting them.

### Features

- Menu-driven interface for user interaction.
- Option to analyze URLs from a single file or all files in a directory.
- Utilizes the URLsVisited class for reading, processing, and displaying URLs.
- Exception handling for file not found scenarios and invalid inputs.
- Displays URLs after removing duplicates and sorting them.

## Assignment 6: Supermarket Sales Analysis Application

This application analyzes and calculates the sales data for a supermarket chain. It processes a 2D array representing sales figures across different branches and products, providing detailed insights into total sales per branch, total sales per product, and overall supermarket sales.

### Features

- Calculates total income per branch.
- Calculates total sales and average income per branch for each product.
- Computes total income for all branches and the average income per branch.
- Utilizes a 2D array to store and process sales data.

## Assignment 7: Supermarket Sales to File Application

This application extends the Supermarket Sales Analysis to write the sales data of different branches in various cities to text files. It sets the supermarket and city names and outputs the total income per branch to respective files, demonstrating file handling and method overriding.

### Features

- Extends functionality of the Supermarket Sales Analysis application.
- Sets supermarket and city names.
- Writes total income per branch to a text file named after the city.
- Utilizes method overriding to customize file output.
- Demonstrates advanced file handling in Java.

## Assignment 8: Sudoku Solver Application

This application solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. It provides a user interface for inputting the puzzle and displays the solution if one exists.

### Features

- Input grid for entering the Sudoku puzzle.
- Implementation of a backtracking algorithm to find solutions.
- Display of the solved puzzle or an indication if no solution exists.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
