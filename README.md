## Assignment 1: Holiday Destination Application

This application allows users to choose their favorite holiday destination from a predefined list. Based on the user's selection, the application will display their favorite destination. This project focuses on user interaction and simple commands by input from the user.

## Assignment 2: AMKA Prediction Application

The AMKA (Greek Social Security Number) application takes an AMKA number and the current year as inputs to predict the sex of the individual. This project demonstrates the use of string manipulation and basic algorithms in Java.

### Features

- Input fields for AMKA number and current year.
- Random prediction of the individual's sex based on the provided AMKA number and use of modulo.

## Assignment 3: Screen Coordinates Application

This application displays the coordinates of the window screen in real-time. It is a simple yet effective tool for understanding screen positioning and event handling in Java.

### Features

- Real-time display of the window's screen coordinates.
- Dynamic updating of coordinates as the window moves.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jimsnns/msc-java-assignments.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

### Usage

1. Navigate to the directory of the assignment you wish to run.
2. Compile and run the Java files.

For example, to run the Holiday Destination Application:
```sh
cd Assignment1
javac HolidayDestinationApp.java
java HolidayDestinationApp
```
